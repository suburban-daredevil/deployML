## Deploy a ML model into an interactive website
Goal: The goal of this project is create a website to gather inputs from the user for the features and make predictions using them using the trained ML model from the backend

### Some tech stack used:
* StreamLit - python based UI development framework
* ML model - pandas, scikit-learn, numpy
* joblib - to serialize, save and reload the trained ML model

I followed [this](https://365datascience.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorials/how-to-deploy-machine-learning-models-with-python-and-streamlit/)
blog to create my web-page
